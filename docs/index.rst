    Python developers love writing code. Tests? Not so much. Whether itâ€™s
    the concepts of testing, or the interface of testing tools, testing is a
    chasm not all cross.

    This tutorial aims to bring Python testing to the masses, taking a new
    approach to first contact with Python testing:

    - Visual testing using PyCharm
    - Driven by the popular pytest framework
    - Real-world scenario during the live building of a simple Python
      application
